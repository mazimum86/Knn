# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks. The KNN algorithm is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm that is easy to implement and understand. It makes predictions based on the k most similar instances in the training data.

## Contents

- `KNN_Implementation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the KNN algorithm implementation.
- `KNN_Scikit_Learn.ipynb`: Practical usage of KNN with scikit-learn.
- `README.md`: Overview of the repository.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/mazimum86/knn.git
     cd knn

2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the KNN algorithm.
