# Knn
This repository contains the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks. The KNN algorithm is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm that is easy to implement and understand. It makes predictions based on the k most similar instances in the training data.
